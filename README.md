Rakerunner was a daemon used to start/stop/monitor rake tasks running on
a server. It is comparable to, though much less feature rich, robust, or
elegent as solutions like Monit, Bluepill, or god.

It also came with a hacked and patched version of cap (from the Capistrano
project) called RRCap, which was used to call control the Rakerunner daemon
remotely.
